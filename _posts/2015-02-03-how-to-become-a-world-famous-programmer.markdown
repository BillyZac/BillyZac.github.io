I like to read the New York Times on my phone on the bus, but what about those typos! I mean, how does that even happen? It's the New York frickin' Times!

The best I can do is send out [a hopelessly ineffectual tweet]().

I also run into pesky typos on the websites of super famous computer places. Like Angular and Ember, just to pick on two.

But here's the great thing about computer programming: When you run across something that's broken, you can actually fix it! For serious! You, little old you, can actually fix the thing that bajillions of people use. Wow!

Let me tell you about a thing that happened yesterday. I was teaching myself Ruby on Rails, reading through the official documentation on their site. And there it was: a typo! Somebody totally forgot to put in an apostrophe! Whaaa! How is this even possible! I mean, this is *the* Ruby on Rails?!?!

But then I remembered, hey, this is Open Source software! I can fix this! Yay!

Fork the repo.
Clone it.
Make the change on my version.
Commit it with a nice message. It seems to be pretty standard to write "Fix typo." When I fixed a typo in the Angular docs, I wrote "Fixed up a tiny little typo, that wasn't so bad, but, ya know, jus' trying to help out, LOLZ!" They were like, "Um, yeah. Thanks for your contribution." So just keep it short and not overly sweet.
Push it to your repo.
Click "Make pull request." You'll be prompted to review your change. Click the obvious stuff, and that's it!
On these big projects, like Rails, there seems to be someone tasked with reviewing these little pull requests. They'll take a look, and if they like your proposed change, they'll merge it into the master code base. You'll see something like this:

And now you're super famous! So until they open source the New York Times, this is my new favorite bus hobby.
